# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting credit card fraud. The goal is to build and evaluate a model that can identify fraudulent transactions based on various features from a credit card transaction dataset.

## Project Structure

- `credit_card_transactions-ibm_v2.csv`: Dataset containing transaction details.
- `sd254_users.csv`: Dataset with user information.
- `sd254_cards.csv`: Dataset with credit card details.
- `fraud_detection.ipynb`: Python script with the main code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

To run the code, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `lightgbm`
- `scikit-learn`
- `imblearn`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn lightgbm scikit-learn imbalanced-learn




### Notes:
- this code is run in kaggle notebook. you can take dataset from there and use there notebook to run this.

This `README.md` file provides a comprehensive overview of the project, how to set it up, and how to use the provided code.
